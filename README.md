# Static Profile Card

## Difficulty: Easy

## Project Description:
In this project, you will create a simple **Profile Card** component using React. The component will display a person's **name**, **job title**, and **bio** passed as props from a parent component.

This exercise will help you practice creating React components, using props, and styling a component with basic HTML and CSS.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand and create **React functional components**.
- Learn how to **pass data between components** using **props**.
- Gain familiarity with **CSS** styling for layout and design.
- Practice creating reusable components in React.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the Profile Card.

## Instructions:
For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the [instructions.md](instructions.md) file.

## How to Complete the Project:
1. Follow the instructions in the `instructions.md` file to create the Profile Card and the `App` component.
2. Implement the ProfileCard component and use props to pass data.
3. Style your profile card as per your design preferences.

## Expected Outcome:
Your app should display a profile card with:
- **Name** in an `<h2>` tag.
- **Job Title** in an `<h3>` tag.
- **Bio** in a `<p>` tag.

The data for the profile card should be passed from the `App` component to the `ProfileCard` component via props.
