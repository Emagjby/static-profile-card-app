# Static Profile Card

## Objective:
Create a simple profile card that displays a person's name, job title, and bio using React components and props.

## Instructions:

1. **Create a `ProfileCard` component:**
    - This component will display a person's profile information (name, title, and bio).
    - It should accept `name`, `title`, and `bio` as props and render them inside the component.

2. **Create an `App` component:**
    - In the `App` component, create an object containing the profile information: `name`, `title`, and `bio`.
    - Pass these values as props to the `ProfileCard` component.

3. **Style the Profile Card:**
    - You can use simple HTML elements like `<h2>` for the name, `<h3>` for the title, and `<p>` for the bio.
    - Apply basic CSS (optional) to style the profile card. For example, add margins, padding, and borders to make it look neat.

4. **Outcome:**
    - Your app should display the profile card with the name, job title, and bio passed from the `App` component as props to the `ProfileCard`.
